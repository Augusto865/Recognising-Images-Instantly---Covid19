# Recognising-Images-Instantly---Covid19
Benefits, limitations and risks of recognising images instantly

# TRAVEL AND NAVIGATION
Benefits - This technology can be used for self driving cars, recognizing images instantly can help with stopping on a red light, going on a green light but also on more important things such as instantly detecting car crashes and also would help avoid pedestrians who cross the street eratically or cars who suddenly break. All of this would make automation from computer-automated cars much safer and also a lot more reliable. AI will always be ready and reliable as humans reactions over time may slow down. This isn't the case with AI.

Limitation - A possible limitation is that the data for recognising images instantly is massive and thus the code for it is very expensive, this will only make computer-automated cars a lot more expensive compared to normal self-driving cars. 

Risk - The AI technology may fail, though unlikely, if its still in developing stages. E.g Tesla cars have killed 2 people driving in computer automated mode. If AI fails that can be extremely dangerous as the car may not respond to sudden changes in it's environment potentially causing harm to the person in the car or others. 

# EDUCATION AND LEARNING
Benefits - being able to scan objects immediately can help in class can help further facilitate knowledge and understanding of a subject. The AI infrastructure can also be used to direct students to other sources of information to facilitate further understanding. e.g scanning a math problem where it instantly recognises the subject/topic can help direct the user to other problems or relevant text books to help and similar topics etc.

Limitation - Many schools especially in rural or less developed countries may not be able to have the technology or an electrical device which facilitates the technology to instantly recognise objects which can be a huge help in lessons. Especially because it can help students learn beyond the classroom but also they gain independence from using it themselves. 

Risks - The replacment of teachers can become more likely. With this tool scanning anything in the classroom or around the world can help you learn about the history, especially in classrooms. Where it may help forge independence, learning is better with a teacher who can sit down with you and explain things slowly until you understand it. The technology may be a good accomplice to learning or a complete replacment of already existing methods of learning which can be risky. 

# TRAVEL AND TOURISM
 Benefits - Can be used by tourists in a museuem or historical city to sacn architecture or chapels to learn more about the history of it and how it was built etc. E.g by scanning a sculpture, It can display things like who built it and its significance at the time. The technology can also help recommend other monuments or achitecture to visit based on how much they liked it. This can also apply to certain signs in foreign countries especially when driving.
 
 Limitations - Again everyone doesn't have an electrical device especially older people so they wouldn't be able to have that freedom to scan objects instantly. 
 
 Risks - If this becomes more wildly used in tourism, certain jobs like tour guides might not exist anymore as the its extremely easy to stand up to an object and scan it. Tour guides may become less desirable if this technology is implemented well thus causing the demand for jobs like these to fall and them to be unemployed. Some may not bother however many people like having someone (like a teacher) to explain certain monuments as they go along. 
 
 # MEDICINE AND HEALTHCARE
 Benefits - Can be largely used in the medicine industry, This AI technology can be used to locate dangerous cancer cells in the body that are mutating. They can help stop the spread of tumours by locating them and destroying h=them early. It may be also be used to help blind people. This techonolgy in a pair of galsses can really help blind people know there surroundings and make life for them a lot easier.
 
Limitations - Extremely expensive to facilitate. To implement these in the NHS hospitals will be extremely expensive and require a lot of money to do so. Also if hospitals manage to get AI technology like this, the expenses may only allow them to have one meachine with this technolgy. If their are many patients. ie a high demand then there may a shortage of patients who can be allowed this technology at one go. If its quite a serious health problem they have then it may be hard to prioritise those eho need it. 

Risks - Like the car, If the technology fails it can cause a lot of bodily harm. E.g if the AI tech fails while checking for a cancerous cell and instead targets a healthy cell, it can be very dangerous and perhaps risky. Some people may also be against using technology like this as they may claim the exposure of cells to technology may cause bodily harm. 

# GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT
Benefits - Cutting edge technology like this can be used inside VR headsets to make them more immersive and realistic inside. They will allow a better realistic/fiction experience. E.g the tech can be used to make your on=wn room into a shooter experience by recognising objects in your room and where the shooter can be. The AI can make things like fictional surroundings more immersive and realistic. E.g by allowing your device to recognise your face and then to put bunny ears on them and then to change background to fit the theme etc. Many possibilities with this. 

Limitations - Again, this technology implemented in consoles and VR headsets will make them very expensive, also if you were to use this technology, it may need to connect to the internet to allow for changes or for you to use the experience. Many people may not have the money to purchase these and also several places around the world have no internet so buying these gadgets may not allow you to utilise it to its fullest. 

Risks - Technology like this can be extremely addictive. The better the AI technology is in making things realistic, the more addictive poeple will get in using them. It may create a addiction problem to kids. Also if the fiction/realistic feature is extremely accurate it may be too immersive and some people may not feel well after using it.
